#### **[Live Site](https://kydzoster.github.io/Olympia-Gym/)**

# Olympia Gym

This website was created for my Second Milestone project for Code Institute:

I chose to build this project as an example website for my local Gym, it serves purely as what I can create for them if they will decide to hire me.

Despite my limited knowledge in website building they liked my page and they are happy to work with me.

## UX

#### USER STORIES

- Users are able to scroll up and down or use navigation menus for contents they are interested.
- Users are able to open links to facebook and instagram, which will open in seperate tab..
- Users are able to contact or book a tour using a contact us section.
- Users are able to see a location of a gym by zooming in on a google map installed next to contact section.
- Users are able to have a BMI check in Metric and Imperial style for both European and British members of a gym.

#### FRAMEWORK

- **Bootstrap**: I prefer to use Bootstrap as it is easy and have constistency. It is supported by vanilla CSS and javaScript.

#### COLOR SCHEME

- The main colour for website is Yellow and Black as they are Olympia Gym colours. background colour is linear-gradient, to give a website better aestetics colour wise (subjective view).

## FEATURES

#### FEATURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED

- Deploy Live website and secure it with protection (either buy a domain or build a server on one of the Olympia Gym computers).

- Implement Direct Debit; online payment system through website.

- Implement Gym Staff online-offline system for specific staff member who is working at this moment.

- These could both potentially be accomplished by further advancing in my Full-Stack studies.

- Gym members testimony/comments for each staff member or gym in general.

## DEPLOYMENT

This particular project does not require any local deployment.

Deployment and source control was entirely done via GitHub. My repository can be found here:

- **Repo: [https://github.com/kydzoster/Olympia-Gym](https://github.com/kydzoster/Olympia-Gym)**

I've published the source code built from the *master branch* using **GitHub Pages**.

The live site can be found here:

- **GH Pages: [https://kydzoster.github.io/Olympia-Gym/](https://kydzoster.github.io/Olympia-Gym/)**

There are no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

## CREDITS

#### CONTENT

Website uses Single page.

Fixed buttons at the left side of the page:

- Facebook
- Instagram

Nav bar consists of 6 clickable buttons from which:

- Olympia Gym (Brand name) and Home returns to the top

- Services smooth scroll to Service section

- About Us opens 3 clickable undersections:
	- About Us
	- Meet our Team
	- Gallery

- Contact Us will slide down to contact section with google map and contact form

- BMI which will open a popup windows for calculating your BMI with 2 tabs:
	- Metric system
	- Imperial system

#### MEDIA

The images used on the buttons are all royalty free vector graphics obtained through a simple Google search. I then used Adobe Photoshop CS6 to create my own markers for the various transportation type.

- [Spinning Globe Loader](http://cdn.lowgif.com/full/7682c56ef78473fe-planet-earth-unitedunderwear-giffy-pinterest-planets.gif)

The images for the map layers (dark, light, earth) were screenshots from my actual project, which I once again used Photoshop to create the actual images used.

I decided not to use Font Awesome just for two tiny icons in the footer, so the [GitHub](https://github.com/logos) and [LinkedIn](https://brand.linkedin.com/) images were obtained through their respective branding pages.

Due to the nature of wanting this project to be entirely open-source, I didn't want to use any CDNs, so downloaded all relevant `.css` and `.js` files for Leaflet and jQuery locally.

#### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

A huge thanks to my *[temporary]* mentor [James Timmins](https://github.com/jhtimmins) for his time, suggestions, and constructive feedback for this project!

Also where credit is due, the concept of getting the animated counter came from Codepen: [jQuery Animated Number Counter From Zero To Value - Javascript Animation by Pouya Saadeghi](https://codepen.io/saadeghi/pen/KdpdoQ). I got the code to work on my own, but with some quick assistance from my mentor, I was able to eliminate nearly 100 lines of repetitive code to accomplish the same concept in only 18 lines.

To remain open-source, I also ensured my project used open-source map-tiles that don't require any API Keys or activation. I'm thankful for [Alex Urquhart's Free Tile Services](http://alexurquhart.github.io/free-tiles/) which allowed me to easily implement 3 base map layers, and a single overlay layer.

Finally, thanks to [Chris Quinn](https://github.com/10xOXR), my accountability partner for all projects, for his feedback and support.
